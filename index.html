    <h1>The impact of Latitude on Climate</h1>
        <p>
            The science of earth climate has revealed unique features of the earths tilt, on the amount, itensity, and duration of sunlight, precipitation, cloud formation, and rainfall on various regions of the earth.  It has been confirmed that the latitude in particular, affects climate by influencing the intensity of the sun in a region. This exposure results in energy (temperature) differences, whereby areas closer to a given latitutde, have higher levels of exposure, than those closer to the poles.
         </p>
    <h3>
        <p>
            Objective
        </p>
    </h3>
    <p>
        The goal of this site is to determine if latitutude, does in fact, impact the amount of temperature, humidity, cloudiness, and wind speed, and if latitudes closer to equator have higher magnitudes than those further away.

        <strong>Specifically:</strong>
        <br>
        <br>
        * Is there a relationship between <a href="lat_temp.html">latitude and max temp</a>. 
        <br>
        * Is there a relationship between <a href="lat_humidity.html">latitude and humidity</a>.
        <br>
        * Is there a relationship between <a href="lat_cloud.html">latitude and cloudiness</a>.
        <br>
        * Is there a relationship between <a href="lat_wind.html">latitude and wind speed</a>.
