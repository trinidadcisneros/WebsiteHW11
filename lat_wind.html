    <p>
        The scatter plot reporesents 500 stochastically selected cities from -60 Lat (southern hemisphere) to ~ 90 Lat (northern hemisphere). The pattern of the scatter plot does not reveal any trends, as the plots for each city is distrubuted along the latitude range, and accross the humidity scale.  This would suggest that although the max temperatures are found closer to the equator, wind speed is not concentrated in one area. Solar energy that heats the area by the equator, is eventually dissipated, including the formation convection current, as air is heated, it rises, and with it, it carries humidity, and move along currents. This dynamic system leads to cities accross the globe with varying wind energy.
