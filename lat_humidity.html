        <p>
        The scatter plot reporesents 500 stochastically selected cities from -60 Lat (southern hemisphere) to ~ 90 Lat (northern hemisphere). The pattern of the scatter plot does not reveal any trends, as the plots for each city is distrubuted along the latitude range, and accross the humidity scale.  This would suggest that although the max temperature are found closer to the equator, humidity is not. Solar energy that heats the area by the equator, is eventually dissipated, including the formation of clouds, which carries the humidity to other parts of the globe, and as a result of this dynamic system, humidity does not linger in a specific region of the globe.
